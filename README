zero-blog
=========

After using jekyll for some time we decided, that it was not what we were looking
for. The idea itself was good, but it made writing blogs without a larger screen
impossible.

That's why we write our own blog system now. It stores the posts in a database
and will have an admin panel. That way, it's possible to write an entry from the
phone too.

Until now, it does not have many features apart from using datamapper and it
will likely not be the blog system you are looking for, without making some
changes for yourself, like the structure for the posts or the design. But maybe
you can build another system out of it.
